      Virat Kohli (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer
      and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays as a
      right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for
      Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the greatest
      batsmen of all time,[4] Kohli holds the records for scoring most runs in
      T20 internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket
      Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also
      contributed to a number of India's successes, including winning the 2011
      World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.

      Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu
      family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his
      mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
      Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[5] Kohli's formative years were spent
      in the Uttam Nagar and commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti
      Public School.[6] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early
      affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket
      bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.

      Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical
      abilities and a dynamic playing demeanor.[361][362] His customarily
      batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly
      open-chested stance,[363] and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his
      bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes,
      and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in
      high-pressure situations.[364][365] In his batting technique, Kohli tends
      to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is
      appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent
      prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region
